# EthioMart-Amharic-NER-System-for-Telegram-E-Commerce-Integration
This project develops an Amharic Named Entity Recognition (NER) system to streamline Ethiopian e-commerce on Telegram. It uses fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract key business information—product names, prices, and locations—from unstructured text, images, and documents shared in Telegram channels.
